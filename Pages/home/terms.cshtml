        Thank you for using Airbnb!

        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Airbnb that govern the right to use the websites, applications, and other offerings from Airbnb (collectively, the “Airbnb Platform”). When used in these Terms, “Airbnb,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the Airbnb entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.

        The Airbnb Platform enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions, and events (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”). As the provider of the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb (or its affiliates) does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services. Airbnb is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Airbnb a real estate broker, travel agency, or insurer. Airbnb is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”). To learn more about Airbnb’s role see Section 15.

        We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services provided to Members by the Airbnb payment entities (collectively "Airbnb Payments").
